- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @cunundrummer
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...
  All things programing.  Games, simulations, new tech, I ‚ù§Ô∏è them all.  Love learning new things.  Love improving on the old things!  Learning is life.  Life is learning!
  
  All things tech and science.  I have a vision of the future, and I love to see it unfold in front of me!!!  Always makes a good conversation. 
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
  Python, and Kivy gui.  When starting out a new language, I learn the fundamentals; the basic language syntax.  Then after making some bad design choices; usually because of not knowing enough of the tools and paradigm of the language, I refactor with gained new knowledge.  With python, I'm proud to say, so far, so good!  
  
  I tend to start with creating a card game - usually not the full experience, but enough to use *most* of the language features (functions, objects, in pythons case - list comprehensions & generators, etc...).  I find card games good to create since they can incorporate the majority of features.  Problem is, I have MANY ideas I like to work on, and experiment with.
  
  I hope to get into and incorporate more ML in the future - hence why I am learning Python.  I might pick up Swift next.  Looks like a beautiful language.  So much to learn, so little time in life :(  Better try to make the most of it!
   
  I do wish I was stronger with testing and git though. While I do use git for my bigger projects (esp. in Angular projects), I could use better mentorship with both.  I have submitted 'PRs', and participated (helped in debugging, gave some solutions) in a few git projects, I'd still like to improve.
  
  Also, I help a lot of students when I'm at the cafe; database help? Check.  Setting up just about any framework? Check.  Finding bugsin there program when they cannot? Check! Usually it is because of horrible consistent naming, and design choices that make things hard for them.  Tracing and debugging is the most common issue because of that. Computer issues (hardware and software)? Easy and fun! Usually leads to nostaligic computer and software history on how I learned to fix all these issues.  Heck, my reddit account gives great to the point advice on how to resolve peoples issues:)  
  
  Learn and help learn!
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...
  anything really.  Wev developemnt with Angular, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Python.  If there is a project anyone wants to work on, I'd be glad to discuss.  
- üì´ How to reach me ...
  as I am reluctant to share too much info on the net - for privacy issues, please try through github.  
  
  I find too much fishing and scamming going on to the point where I become more private online.  I was a victim of hacking thanks to some sites weak/outdated security. I'll try to prevent it from happening again even though my 'sociability score' goes down.  A good discussion I like to have is - is privacy the key to anti-dystopia?  Hmmm ;)
